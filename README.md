# Semi-Supervised-Video-Anomaly-Detection
This project addresses automated detection of abnormal events in videos using deep learning. Developed for Pixel Play 2026 hosted by VLG IIT Roorkee, it uses a labeled training dataset of normal videos to identify and detect anomalies in unseen test videos.
